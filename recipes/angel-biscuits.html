        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is an easy and quick recipe for deliciously light, moist, and soft biscuits</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package of regular or quick active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons warm water (105F to 115F)</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar or sweetener of choice</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shortening or butter</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 400F. Dissolve yeast in warm water; set aside</li><br>
            <li>Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in shortening/butter <br>
                using pastry blender or crisscrossing 2 knives, until mixture looks like fine crumbs (you can <br> 
                also use your hands). Stir in yeast mixture and just enough buttermilk so dough leaves side <br>
                of bowl and forms a ball.</li><br>
            <li>Place dough on generously floured surface; gently roll in flour to coat. Knead lightly 25 to <br>
                30 times, sprinkling with flour if dough is too sticky. Roll or pat 1/2 inch thick. Cut with <br>
                floured 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter,or use the rim of a cup. Place about 1 inch apart on <br>
                ungreased cookie sheet.</li><br>
            <li>Optional: cover biscuits and let them rise in a warm place for 30 minutes before baking as <br>
                directed. These will give them an even more irresistibly light and airy texture.</li><br>
            <li>If not cooking them immediately cover and place in fridge, taking them out an hour in advance. <br>
                Bake 12 to 14 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet. Brush with <br>
                butter. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
