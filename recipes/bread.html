        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a simple and fairly easy bread recipe adjusted for high altitude.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups and 2 Tablespoons lukewarm water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons and 3 3/4 teaspoons honey or maple syrup</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups Whole Wheat or All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons plus a dash of salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Weight your flour; our measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off <br>
                any excess</li><br>

            <li>Put all of the ingredients into the bread pan. Program for basic white bread (or whole <br>
                wheat if your machine has this setting), and press start.</li><br>

            <li>Remove the bread from the bread machine when it's done. Either turn it out of the pan <br>
                onto a rack to cool; or turn it out of the pan, place it back in the machine (atop the <br>
                structure that holds the pan), crack the lid open about 1", and let it cool right in the <br>
                cooling-down machine. This helps prevent the crust from wrinkling as the loaf cools</li><br>

        </ol>
